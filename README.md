# MyResume_Experience_Polynomial_Regression

## Project Summary
I thought it would be a fun project to go through my skills in my Resume and turn the years into a Polynomial graph.

# Process of Project
 - created a JSON file with 5 categories
 - a list of experience/skills in each category
 - The number of years of each skill in each category
 - Then the application reads the json file
 - Then uses Polynomial Regression of the years

# Use This Project (It's fun)
Change the json file to your skills.
Rename the file format
Then give it a go

Why not turn your skills into a Polynomial?!
